### Javascript Application Report
This project was generated by Nicole Muldoon (52093049), a 2nd year Zoology BsC student in the School of Biological Sciences.

### Tools Utilised
I added a script known as Nodemon to the application – this made design easier as it allows me to make changes to the code, which Nodemon then detects and ‘refreshes’ the application on my behalf, without the need to restart the server, thus allowing me to observe changes in real time. 

I also made use of Moment.js for the chat room. This is useful as via code implication, it allows users to observe real-time events as they happen in the chat: whenever a message is sent or a user enters or leaves the chat, the real time appears alongside either the client or server’s message. 

### References to sources 
Being new to JavaScript, I struggled to manipulate the sample code provided. I did an enormous amount of research, and finally found a system that worked for me without use of the sample code. Most of my code in JavaScript was modelled around a tutorial made by Brad Traversy on GitHub known as ‘ChatCord’ – following his advice, I was able to understand the fundamentals of what each part of the application was doing, and was able to implement his processes into my self-designed ‘chat.html’. 

It is through Traversy’s tutorial that I also learned how to use Nodemon, which (as mentioned previously) was extremely useful to application development. His source can be accessed here: https://github.com/bradtraversy/chatcord.

### Challenges
I faced enormous challenges throughout the entire development of this project. Time constraints were a large issue, as due to the high demands of mandatory biological courses, it left little time available for me to work on code. On top of this, I had several issues at home, including the birth of puppies and drastically ill health, both of which affected my commitment to education. 

 also suffered various errors throughout the production of this application. Most of these were to do with JavaScript, as I spent countless hours re-editing code to make adjustments, as one change could result in a domino effect of errors. Unlike HTML, JavaScript is entirely new to me, and as a non-Computer Science student I found it extremely difficult to understand and get a handle of, especially in the short available learning term for the course. I feel as if, given more time than the 16-week block this programme offers, these challenges faced would have been less difficult.

Other errors I encountered were permission based. For the entire year, I have faced issues trying to preview my code in external tabs, which was specifically problematic in CA4. I am not used to programming environments, so using others such as Visual Studio did not feel like an option to me, meaning I relied on the Codio learning environment to perform tasks. This error was eventually resolved the day before the assessment (extension) deadline, by re-installing my browser, as clearing caches and cookies surprisingly did not work. This fix allowed me to view multiple user connections to the server, which was useful in determining the functionality of the code.

I also felt challenged by the overall project – I’m chronically ill, and because of my ill health I haven’t really thought much about building a portfolio for myself, so I wasn’t sure how to structure the index or about me section to reflect what a portfolio should show. 

Completing the project in the final days was problematic, as I unfortunately suffered a great loss, whereby my guinea pig passed away on 17th December, whilst I still had an enormous amount of work to cover after fixing the errors which had held me in my tracks. This may explain why my code is not perfect.

### Problems with errors
When testing the application using JSLint, I kept running into several warning errors, which when I attempted to fix upon advice of friends and software experts, led to further complications and errors in my code. As a result, there are few minor errors when the JavaScript pages are run through this application. This is something I may need to look into in the future, but for now did not affect the final presentation of my project.

### Design 
In terms of design, I wanted this website to feel minimalistic, as this is my preferred style when I view webpages online – I am not fond of bold colours and extravagant elements, as personally these affect my vision. Based off of this choice, I went for a more muted colour palette which I feel reflects my aesthetic better. As this is supposed to a portfolio, I wanted the design to reflect what I like. Bootstrap elements were also added to the project which I customised using CSS to suit my needs.

I tried to match the colour of the chat application to the main website (the blue being similar to the colour of the bone in the dog’s mouth of the header). This is something I feel worked well, as it meant moving between individual pages had a more uniform flow. 

I have never coded using semantic HTML before, so this was challenging when personalising the chat application. It was strange to use, for example, <section> over, where in the past, I would normally use <div>. Despite this strange challenge for me, I felt as if it worked well, and it allowed me to clearly view the structure of the page in my mind throughout development. 

### How it Works
To be perfectly honest, I am still unsure as to how a lot of the code works together. I did not feel as if I had enough time to learn individual components of JavaScript, and a lot of my friends in software engineer careers were shocked to learn of the level of material we had to learn in a small time frame. 

I understand that the socket.io tool allows for communication between the client (user) and the server (terminal). I could observe these effects by using console logs throughout development, which allowed me to view in the terminal and client log when a new user was connecting or when a message was sent before these signals were committed to the page. Changes in the client.js, index.js and chat.html allowed these changes to be viewed on the screen rather than the logs, through removing hard code from the HTML (leaving behind only empty divs) and using query selectors in client.js to parse user and input information into the empty div. Using socket.emit in the index.js allowed indication of when users entered the chat, by visualising this information to the current room using the to() command within the io element. 

Whilst my understanding of individual elements and their connectivity is not perfect, I feel as if I grasp enough of a basic understanding to challenge myself in further projects. 

### Missing elements

As you will see from the code, there is no 'User is typing...' functionality. This was not added due to time constraints surrounding the project, and my own personal issues at home (bereavement, ill health, etc.). I know that this relies on the keypress() functionality, but I did not fully understand how to work this, and so this is something I will have to research more.
